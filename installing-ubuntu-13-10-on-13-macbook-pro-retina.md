The timing of the release of OSX mavericks and Ubuntu 13.10 was
interesting to say the least.  I was naive enough to go ahead and
upgrade my OSX system to mavericks without fully backing up both my OSX
and Ubuntu data.  The good news is that the upgrade went well on the OSX
side.  The bad news is that my Ubuntu partition was not able to load.  I
wanted to restore Ubuntu on my Mac and found my [previous
post](/2013/05/01/installing-ubuntu-13-04-on-13-macbook-pro-retina-102/)
to be extremely helpful.  The only difference was to grab the correct
[wifi drivers](http://packages.ubuntu.com/saucy/bcmwl-kernel-source)
from Saucy Salamander instead of Raring Ringtail.
